# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I tried learning how to code a few summers back but I always get stuck in tutorials and stuff untill my lazyness gets to me and I stop. I am commited to mastering the basics this summer then find the most suitable role for me and focus on enhancing my skills there.
